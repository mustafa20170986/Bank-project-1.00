jwt flow->

intro:
a user login with required credentials then the server generated id token, accesstoken and refresh token for him 
id token-> " who is he" 
access token ->"ehat does he can access?"
refresh token-> access token are sensitive one can have control over the sensitive rooute or api gate way through it .so access token are short lived 15 min.
refresh token are stored in a db and refresh token are long llived there for it has ability to grnrrate access token .
token revocation -> lets say a user have logedd out the the curent refresh token will be discard . so that no one can use it
rotation of reffresh token-> every time a refresh token is  used a new refresh token is generated .

example:
a user have login in an app the server generate id token , accesstoken,refresh token 
the user login to a protected route using admin access token. after 15 mimutes the access token have expired . the refresh token send another access token.the refresh token is
used now which riggered rotation of refrresh token as a reslut new refresh token is created.and the cyle keeps repeated
